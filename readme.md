THIS IS A MUST READ: EULA OR WATEVER!
You can read and use, but IT WAS MADE FOR MY OWN USAGE: implies it will not neccesarily do anything for anyone!!
It's not a lie! You'd have to compile it and shiz! It might lead to any kind of event! No responsibilities on anyone ever.

SETP NOE!
Wizv Cmake installed welp you'd only need to:
>>> change the project name in root CmakeLists.txt (to remove the overrides and local stuff by changing the target easily)
>>> Import MTR | AISAF
>>> define either of these 
>>> BUILD IT!

This version works with FameKat
